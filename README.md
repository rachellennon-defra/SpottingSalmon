_Developing Automated Approaches to Monitoring Salmon Populations Using Machine Learning and Computer Vision Techniques_ 

A research and development project aimed at automating the monitoring of salmon populations using machine learning and computer vision technologies.

Traditional methods for monitoring fish populations are time-consuming, and resource intensive. This project explores how AI techniques can improve the efficiency of salmon monitoring to support conservation and sustainable fishery practices.
